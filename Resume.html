  Health Monitoring device based on IoT in SIH finale
  <small class="text-muted">Most Awarded Project</small>
</h3>
<pre class="blockquote">
	This was a IoT based embaded system project done by me and my team of 6 people.
	This was not only a hardware project but was also a software. While doing this 
	project we learned android app development a bit and also we completed the work 
	of Arduino based microcontroller to control the connected sensors to recive
	the date and send it on mobile screen.it was challenging for us but we takled 
	all the problems to complete it. we did not only got selected for the SIH but 
	also reached in finale.

<p class="h5">IoT Based Automatic dustbin</p>
<pre class="blockquote">
	This Project is a bin based on IoT it consists of ultrasonic sensor and
	Arduino uno with servo motor.The Work of servo motor is to rotate the lid
	of bin at the angle of 90 degree when it will recive instruction from
	Arduiono Uno with the help of the data Arduino recived from ultrasonic sensor.

</h3>
<pre class="blockquote">
	This is a arduino powered robot and the intresting thing is we used 2 
	diffrent types of arduinos in it . to controle the lower body we used
	Arduino uno and to control the upper body we used arduino lilypad.
